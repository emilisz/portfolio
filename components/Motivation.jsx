          I love to write code <span className=" text-green-400">&#x2665;</span>. Experience with projects from scratch to
          deploying. Knowing that client almost always right, and always expects
          <span className=" text-green-400"> best results</span>, it is necessary to <span className=" text-green-400">deliver excellent outcome</span> . I will
          work towards YOUR vission (not mine) in the best possible manner. One
          of my strongest asset is constantly keep learning and handle every
          criticism and feedback positively.
